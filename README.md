What's inside?
--------------

This projet has been produced by two masters student from France, currently following the Networks and Network Security course.

The goal of our project is to provide students, or anyone who has a passion for information security, a virtual lab where they can practice their skills. We aimed our exercises to be offensive oriented, and tried to cover a wide area of the subject, without going deep into each of them.

We had this idea because we are true infosec enthusiasts, and like all enthusiasts persons, we wanted to share our knowledge and passion with others. The second thing is that, the offensive side of security is not really covered by schools, so we wanted to contribute in order to improve that.
